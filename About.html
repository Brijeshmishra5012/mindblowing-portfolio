        <p style="font-weight: 1.6rem; font-family: 'Trebuchet MS', 'Lucida Sans Unicode', 'Lucida Grande', 'Lucida Sans', Arial, sans-serif;">A web application is any software that runs in a web browser. It is created in a browser-supported programming language (such as the combination of JavaScript, HTML and CSS) and relies on a web browser to render the application.

          Web applications are, therefore, computer programs allowing website visitors to submit and retrieve data to/from a database over the internet using their preferred web browser.
          
          The data is then presented to the user within their browser as information is generated dynamically (in a specific format, e.g. in HTML using CSS) by the web application through a web server.
          Web App Developers define just how the data is transferred and related between the website and the user. So behind that Gmail or Steam icon on your desktop, there is a great deal of sophisticated architecture at work.

          As an aspiring Web App Developer, you can spend countless hours immersing yourself in online lectures, tutorials, strategy guides and essentially polishing up on the theory of how the machine works. Still, oftentimes, there is no substitute for hands-on experience.</p>

          Strong graphic designers are out there, and having a top-notch job post is key to engaging with them. The job description will be your organization’s first impression for most potential candidates, illustrating your mission, values, and expectations. As job seekers pursue the right fit, your goal should be to make the job description compelling, concise, and direct. A good rule of thumb is to include no more than six bullets of information in each section. Once you have a first draft, read it carefully to ensure that it aligns with expectations for the role, and to verify that all details are accurate.
